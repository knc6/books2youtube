# Books2youtube

Books2tube is a project that converts open-access books and PDFs into audio/video content and uploads them to YouTube using the YouTube API.

Currently, it features books on Vedanta philosophy, but the scope is not limited to that. If you have any good book suggestions, especially those with a positive, inspirational, or sci-fi tone, please share them by opening an issue on GitHub.

The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna has been converted into YouTube videos for each chapter (54 parts) and sub-chapter (1,370 parts). Other available titles include Bhagavad Gita (in both Hindi and English) and Vivekachudamani.

Detailed scripts coming soon!
